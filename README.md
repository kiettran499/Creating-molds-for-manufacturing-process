## Description

- The project is to design molds for a plastic bottle manufacturing process called blow molding.
- The plastic bottle having a capacity of 500 ml, made of PET with a shrinkage coefficient of 0.4% when cooling.
- The molds are to be machined from a rectangular block of 150mm x 150mm x 250mm, made from 6061-T6 aluminum alloy.
- The bottle is constructed in Solidworks and the molds are created by Solidworks CAM.
- Because the bottle is non-conventional shape or designed with deep, narrow cavities that are difficult to reach, we use 3 axis mill operations.
- The toolings in Solidworks CAM have to be available on the market.
- By using Solidworks CAM, the G-code for machining all molds features will be developed while optimizing the tool path to minimize the total machining time for each part.

## Design & Result

-  Design of a plastic bottle.

- The estimated machining time for mold parts, resulting from our CNC programs:
  - Bottom Mold is 20.23 minutes = 20 minutes : 14 seconds.
  - Side 1 Mold is 105.91 minutes = 1 hour : 45 minutes :55 seconds.
  - Side 2 Mold is 99.53 minutes= 1 hour: 39 minutes : 32 seconds.
